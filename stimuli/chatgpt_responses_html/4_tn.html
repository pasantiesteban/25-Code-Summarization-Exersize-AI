<p>(1) <strong>Code Comment Summary for <code>afterWorkbookDispose</code> Method:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>afterWorkbookDispose</code> method addresses an issue related to writing dimensions in an Excel workbook. It operates on a <code>WriteWorkbookHolder</code> object, checking if it is non-null and an instance of <code>SXSSFWorkbook</code>. It iterates through the initialized sheets in the workbook, ensuring each sheet is a valid <code>SXSSFSheet</code> and attempts to access its underlying <code>XSSFSheet</code> using reflection. For each valid sheet, it calculates the header size and the last row index to set the dimension ref attribute appropriately on the <code>CTWorksheet</code> object. Logging is included for error handling.</p>
