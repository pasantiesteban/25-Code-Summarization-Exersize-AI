Initialization bug</p>
<p>The bug is in the <code>fillImage</code> method, specifically in the initialization of the <code>drawing</code> object. <code>sheet.getDrawingPatriarch()</code> might return <code>null</code>, and although <code>drawing</code> is then initialized, further usage does not take null safety into account, which could lead to <code>NullPointerException</code>.
