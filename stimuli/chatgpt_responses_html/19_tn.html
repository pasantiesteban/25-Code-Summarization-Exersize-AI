<h3>(1) Summary of <code>generate</code> Method</h3>
<p>The <code>generate</code> method creates a textual representation of a graph using provided nodes and edges. It initializes the context and processes each node, handling subgraphs recursively. The method then iterates over conditional and parallel edges to construct appropriate calls and conditions, appending them to the context. It concludes by appending a footer, returning the completed context as a string.</p>
