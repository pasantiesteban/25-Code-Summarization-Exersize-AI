<li><strong>Code Comment Summary for <code>buildUserModel</code> Method:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>buildUserModel</code> method constructs and returns an instance of the user-defined model by populating its fields based on the provided cell data and metadata. It retrieves the model class type from <code>ExcelReadHeadProperty</code> and uses reflection to instantiate it. The method then iterates over the header map, retrieves corresponding field names, and converts cell data into Java objects using the field information and a converter map. It populates the BeanMap with these field-value pairs and ensures that field values are assigned, even if the entity class has non-standard setters. If any exception occurs during instantiation, an <code>ExcelDataConvertException</code> is thrown with relevant details.</p>

   Reflective Instantiation</p>
<p>The bug in the <code>buildUserModel</code> method is the use of <code>newInstance()</code> which is deprecated. This approach can lead to various issues such as failing to instantiate if a constructor isn’t accessible. The correct approach is to use <code>getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()</code>.</p>
