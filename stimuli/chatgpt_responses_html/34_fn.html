<p>(1) <strong>Code Comment Summary for the 'after' method:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>after</code> method processes a <code>ChatClientResponse</code> to manage document references in the chat response. If references are enabled, it checks if the response is incomplete by evaluating the finish reason. If incomplete, it appends the current output to a cumulative content storage in the context. Once complete, it identifies and extracts document references from the full response content using regular expressions. These references are used to retrieve and store the referenced documents. The method then builds and returns a modified <code>ChatClientResponse</code> object with updated metadata, including the documents that were referenced.</p>
