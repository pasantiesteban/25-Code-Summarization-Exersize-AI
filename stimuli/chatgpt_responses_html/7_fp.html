<p>(1) <strong>Code Comment Summary for <code>buildChain</code> method</strong></p>
<p>The <code>buildChain</code> method initializes and maintains execution chains for different types of write handlers, specifically <code>CellWriteHandler</code>, <code>RowWriteHandler</code>, <code>SheetWriteHandler</code>, and <code>WorkbookWriteHandler</code>. It checks if these handlers are applicable for the current execution context (<code>runOwn</code>) and adds them to the respective chain (<code>cellHandlerExecutionChain</code>, <code>rowHandlerExecutionChain</code>, etc.). If <code>runOwn</code> is true, it handles the "own" chains separately (<code>ownSheetHandlerExecutionChain</code>, etc.). It ensures the handlers are added in order and updates the class's <code>writeHandlerList</code>.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>Bug Identification</strong></p>
<p>yes</p>
<p>There is a potential issue related to thread safety in the method <code>sortAndClearUpHandler</code> and the usage of class-level variables such as <code>writeHandlerList</code>. If multiple threads access this shared object, it can lead to concurrent modification exceptions or inconsistent behavior. Ensure proper synchronization or use thread-safe data structures if this code is intended to be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.</p>
