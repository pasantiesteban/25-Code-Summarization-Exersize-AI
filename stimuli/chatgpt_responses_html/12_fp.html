<p><strong>Summary of <code>headCellRangeList</code> Method:</strong></p>
<p>This method calculates all the cell ranges in an Excel header that need to be merged based on identical header names across columns and rows. It constructs a list of <code>CellRange</code> objects, representing these ranges. The method uses a set to keep track of already processed cells to prevent redundant merging operations.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>There is a potential logic bug in the method where it does not correctly handle the merging of cells that are part of a diagonal pattern across the header when both columns and rows need merging separately. The existing logic might incorrectly skip merging some cells if the pattern of identical headers occurs diagonally. Adjustments in the loop conditions might be necessary to handle such cases properly.</p>
